# RoadWatch MVP — Implementation Checklist

High-level plan (tight loop): Core services → Database & seed loader → Proximity engine & alert logic → UI screens → Import/Export → Testing & validator

- [x] Analyze requirements / current project state
- [x] Create high-level implementation plan (core services → DB → proximity engine → UI → import/export → testing)

Core services (Location, TTS, Permissions)

- [x] Location service (foreground + background, permission handling) — DriveModeService implemented and Hilt-wired
- [x] DriveModeService improvements (start/stop reliability, foreground notification refinement, battery / sampling strategy) — basic improvements implemented (notification updates)
- [x] Text-to-Speech manager integration and configuration — TextToSpeechManager present and wired into service
- [x] Runtime permission manager (location, notifications, foreground service) — implemented (HomeFragment + MainActivity wiring)
- [ ] Unit tests for core services

Database layer

- [ ] Room entities for Hazard and related models — partial (entities present)
- [ ] DAOs (HazardDao present — review & finalize) — partial
- [ ] Database provider and migration strategy (RoadWatchDatabase present — wire & verify) — partial
- [ ] Seed loader to import app assets/seeds.csv into DB (SeedLoader exists under data/repository — review) — partial
- [ ] Integration tests / DB validator

Proximity engine + alert logic

- [x] Implement ProximityAlertEngine use-case (distance calc, hysteresis, rate-limiting alerts) — implemented
- [x] Tie engine to location updates and HazardRepository — wired into DriveModeService and observing active alerts
- [ ] Alert policy (sound, TTS, vibration, repeat suppression) — basic TTS & vibration performed by TextToSpeechManager
- [ ] Unit tests for proximity math and suppression rules

UI screens

- [x] Home screen (list status, quick toggle) — implemented (HomeFragment start/stop + status observation wired)
- [ ] Drive HUD screen (map, current hazard, nearby hazard indicator) — partial (DriveHudScreen exists)
- [ ] Passenger mode screen (browse hazards, report) — partial (PassengerModeScreen exists)
- [ ] Settings screen (voice, thresholds, import/export) — partial (SettingsScreen exists)
- [ ] Accessibility (large text, TTS test button)
- [ ] UI integration tests (Compose)

Import / Export functionality

- [ ] CSV import (seeds + user data) — partial (ImportExportManager exists; review)
- [ ] Export (backup) JSON/CSV
- [ ] Conflict resolution & validation on import

App wiring / DI

- [x] DI modules: ensure CoreModule/ServiceModule/DatabaseModule/DomainModule are wired and used by Application — Hilt modules present and Application annotated
- [x] Application lifecycle handling for services (start/stop on user action / boot) — basic start/stop wiring implemented (MainActivity/HomeFragment)

Testing & validator

- [ ] Unit tests for domain/usecases (Proximity, Repository logic)
- [ ] Instrumentation tests for core flows (start drive, receive hazard, alert)
- [ ] End-to-end smoke test script

Release helpers & docs

- [x] create-release-with-datetime.sh exists
- [ ] CI integration for building release artifacts
- [ ] README updated with features & developer steps
- [ ] Developer notes for testing and seeding DB

Repository quick-scan notes (from current tree)

- app/src/main/java/com/roadwatch/core/location/DriveModeService.kt — exists (uses stubbed interfaces)
- app/src/main/java/com/roadwatch/core/tts/TextToSpeechManager.kt — exists (verify)
- app/src/main/java/com/roadwatch/data/entities/Hazard.kt — exists
- app/src/main/java/com/roadwatch/data/dao/HazardDao.kt — exists
- app/src/main/java/com/roadwatch/data/db/RoadWatchDatabase.kt — exists
- app/src/main/assets/seeds.csv — present
- app/src/main/java/com/roadwatch/data/repository/SeedLoader.kt — exists
- app/src/main/java/com/roadwatch/domain/usecases/ProximityAlertEngine.kt — exists (verify completeness)
- UI: Home/Drive/Passenger/Settings screens are present under feature/\*

Next recommended step (pick one)

- Start by auditing and running the unit tests / static checks (if any) to see failing areas, OR
- Begin wiring the ProximityAlertEngine implementation into DriveModeService (replace stub) so end-to-end flow can be tested live.

If you confirm, I will proceed to: create a small audit report by opening and scanning the core files (ProximityAlertEngine.kt, TextToSpeechManager.kt, HazardDao.kt, RoadWatchDatabase.kt, SeedLoader.kt) and report which parts are complete vs missing, then advance task_progress to 5% and propose immediate concrete code changes.
